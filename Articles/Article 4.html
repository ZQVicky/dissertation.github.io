        <h2>Article 4: The studentification effects upon Cardiff</h2>
        <h4>Studentification has been evidenced as a common phenomenon in some UK university towns since the 1990s. The earliest form can be called HMO‐ization of family housing (Nakazawa 2017). Previously, studies believed that overflowing students in residential areas would “cause conflicts with local residents”, “displaces low‐income households”, and “intensifies socio-spatial segregation”(ibid). However, it is an inevitable consequence because of the expansion of higher education. </h4>

        <p>Lan Lloyd-Davies, Media Advisor of Cardiff Council, supported “Students bring a host of benefits to a city which includes: local regeneration and supporting local businesses – particularly cafes, restaurants, bars, clubs and shops, attracting investment, and creating a strong labour market.”</p>
        <p>Students arguably do bring benefits to the places they live in, but as Nakazawa(2017) identified they can impact a community in a negative way, such as by “running down neighbourhoods” and “leaving places as ghost towns in the summer”</p>
        <p>Before PBSAs had been envisaged, students have no choice but live in residential areas nearby the school they studied at. Because of the increasing demand of students, landlords are more likely to pursue a large portfolio of letting property to students. This results in some families have been displaced out of university areas.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the rental market has been driven higher. Lan Lloyd-Davies, explained, “The price to rent a property is governed by the market, through supply and demand. If a specific area of the city is more popular, due to location to amenities, public transport or other factors, then demand may be higher than supply so the price for a property in that area may increase.”</p>
        <p>Ali Jama, a security guard in the city centre, supported, “ The effect of students on the rental price is quite big, the price is always going up from the students, and it is really hard to find a house in Cathays and Roath because of all student.”</p>
        <p>He added, “It is really hard to find a house in Cardiff, it take up to five years now, you have to rent privately, but private costs too much, social houses need to be cheaper. I would like the local authority to create more flats for the general public or accommodation for all. ”</p>
        <p>The Council is keen to ensure that the benefits and perceived shortfalls that students bring to Cardiff are spread across a wider area of the city so the Supplementary Planning Guidance for HMO’s was brought in on October 20th 2016.</p>
        <p>The council believes that by dispersing students across a wider area of the city,  the benefits to local communities include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creating a better balance in Cathays, Plasnewydd and other wards between students, families and smaller households. Reducing issues relating to litter and waste being put out onto the streets outside collection day.</li>
          <li>Creating a better community spirit in Cathays and Plasnewydd by creating a better balance of the make-up of the population living in these areas.</li>
          <li>Ensuring that the economic benefits that students bring is spread across a wider area.</li>
          <li>Ensuring that purpose built student accommodation is able to cater for and can manage the amount of waste produced by students.</li>
          <li>Ensure that the locations of these developments are close to local amenities and close to public transport.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mr. Lloyd-Davies stated, “Further work is now ongoing to develop supplementary planning guidance on flats in areas such as Cathays and Plasnewydd for the same reasons as guidance was put in place for HMO’s.”</p>
        <p>Since the inception of PBSA’s as a new type of student accommodation this has helped the council to disperse the concentration of students in HMOs.  have been proposed, it seems help council dispersed a part of students from HMOs. The Council believes that the increase in the number of PBSA housing has increased the choice for students.</p>
        <p>Ian Lloyd-Davies states, “Historically student accommodation has been defined to specific areas of the city, mainly Cathays and Plasnewydd. In recent years, further options have become available for students with purpose built accommodation available in or near to the city centre. Students are a very important part of Cardiff’s population and they make a positive impact on the local economy. They bring a host of benefits to a city which includes: local regeneration and supporting local businesses – particularly cafes, restaurants, bars, clubs and shops, attracting investment, and creating a strong labour market.”</p>
        <p>He added, “This increased choice for students is a good thing for the city, to ensure that one certain area does not become over saturated with students, who mainly only live in the city for part of the year while they carry out their studies.”</p>
        <p>However, the local consumption level would be driven to a higher level by the students. Liamo Davies, an English teacher in Cardiff, agreed, “The cost of living in the cities are always expensive. However, some city like Lancaster if there were no student there, there would be no town, students bring lots of economy benefits for a university town. Cardiff is the same, it has been changed a lot, the Cardiff bay is a new world compare to the year when I was young. Students bring the efficient market money into the city, without the students, this city might just be a normal town, but now it is all around by the international students. I was a student in a normal town, the economy is very down, I suppose that the student village/town/city is a very good thing.”</p>
        <p>He continued, “I lived in the south of Hampshire in the last few years, but now I have been back to Cardiff. I think Cardiff grew significantly. When I was a young man, there was not a lot opportunities, the university was not that big, but now, it’s completely different, I would like find a job here and settle down. Actually, I have been looking for some studio or one-bedroom apartment these days, I have to say that the price is quite expensive.” </p>
        <p>However, despite this, PBSAs in the residential areas have impacted negatively upon the community. The key headache seems to be amenity concerns surrounding noise. There were more than 1,500 noise complaints received by the Council’s Noise Pollution Service in the last five years only in Cathays area. </p>
        <p>Cardiff Council (2015) pointed out, ”Cathays has the highest proportion of complaints in the City and this can be attributable to lifestyle issues, such as a high proportion of students, younger people and the density of housing stock, e.g. number of flats, proportion of terraced properties. The playing of amplified music is the major cause of noise complaints in the Cathays area and across the City.” </p>
        <p>Ali Jama, the security guard of Cardiff Library, said, “The students make the city very busy, and more recognisable, brings more to the city more business wise. The residents seem to be ok but the students come sometimes bring with them anti-social behaviour and drunkenness, especially on weekends.” </p>
        <p>Tianhe Luo who lived in Colum Road for two years cannot agree anymore. This road located four student PBSAs (740 spaces) and numerous HMOs accommodated students. And also the only route for 3,655 students who live in Talybont’s and Maindy’s student halls. He complained, “Because my room is front street and at the ground floor, the noise from traffic and students really has an effect on my sleep, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. I don’t know why they went to the bars at midnight and then screaming ang sing loudly on the street. When they come back and pass by my window, they act just like animals getting drunk. Sometimes I have been woke suddenly with a start.”</p>
        <p>However, people from other areas which are far away from the “student ghetto” have different experiences. Sue Evans, works in Cardiff Library, lived in Grangetown, said “ They built a new student block where I live, just one, the fact is that they built a purpose-built student accommodation that now we got a large shop on the corner, so that’s good, it’s convenient, as they realised that the students will use it as well as the people who live there. I don’t know if they would have been built if they haven’t built the student buildings. I don’t think any negative things happened to me so far. Because I’m not near to them so the noise does not affect me where I live. “</p>
        <p>She stated, “The one I have mentioned to you isn’t terribly high, it’s in a reasonable height, but if I live in a residential area, I wouldn’t necessarily want to see tower blocks built right by me, but most of them in town, not in the residential area. But some of them built in the base of some historic buildings is not a good thing.” </p>
        <p>Like Mrs. Evans said, most Cardiff people do not mind the increasing high-rise buildings in the city centre, but they are not willing to see historic buildings being rebuilt because some of the new buildings will change the street scene. Last Year, an historic hospital was demolished so a new student accommodation could be constructed. The developer hoped this large-scale site can be the “landmark development”. However, some councillors expressed concerns when the plans were approved by the Cardiff council planning committee.</p>
        <p>Former Labour councillor Manzoor Ahmed mentioned told to Wales Online: “I am really saddened to see this historic building and rare features go. I was very sad to see this particular facility go. This was a popular hospital in Cardiff at one time. Unfortunately we have to move with the times.” (Deacon 2017)</p>
